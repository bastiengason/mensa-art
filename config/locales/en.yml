#       question10: "How do you do it?"
#       answer10: "I'm glad you asked, it's magic. Actually it's pretty simple. Each day we'll perform many tasks in order to grow your account, following, unfollowing, liking, etc to organically grow your audience."
#       question11: "Do you post content to my account?"
#       answer11: "You remain in control of all the content you post. We do not post any content for you. This allows you to solely focus on posting the best material possible, while we focus on bringing you the right audience to view your posts. It is important that you continue posting content regularly to your account, as potential new followers only tend to follow active accounts."
#       question12: "Why does the number of new followers each month vary?"
#       answer12: "There are several factors. In general, it is related to the size of the account from the start and target niche. Once we get good momentum with growing your followers, the faster we can run with results every month."
#       question 13: "Why should I post content to my account regularly?"
#       answer13: "It is important to continue posting content to your account on a regular basis. Since these are real people, they're much more likely to follow and remain following an active account."
#       question14: "Can I keep posting? Can I still follow and unfollow accounts?"
#       answer14: "Yes! You can resume doing your normal activity. We will be working in the background, but your account will still be 100% in your possession."

#       question16: "Do I have to verify my account?"
#       answer16: "You will likely need to verify your account. This happens from multiple computer logins. Your social media platform is just confirming with you to secure your account. Don’t worry, your account is 100% safe."
#       question17: "How do I get started?"
#       answer17: "It’s pretty simple, after choosing your plan you will receive a brief survey to complete and then you'll be able to confirm your plan. We'll be in touch to let you know when're getting started. Done and done."
